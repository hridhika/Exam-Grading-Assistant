### Project Description
The Exam Grading Assistant is a web application that automates the evaluation of handwritten answer scripts. It uses image preprocessing and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text from scanned images, providing efficient and accurate text analysis for grading purposes.


### The Problem statement
Grading handwritten exams is a tedious and error-prone process, especially when deciphering illegible handwriting or managing large volumes of answer scripts. The Exam Grading Assistant solves this "critical issue" by automating text extraction, saving educators from squinting at messy handwriting and endless hours of manual grading!

### The Solution
We‚Äôre giving teachers their time (and sanity) back! The Exam Grading Assistant takes messy, handwritten answer sheets, sprinkles a bit of AI magic with image preprocessing and OCR, and delivers the extracted text on a silver platter. No more decoding hieroglyphics‚Äîjust upload, process, and relax!
